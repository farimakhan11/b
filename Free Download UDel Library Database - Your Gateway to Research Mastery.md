## Understanding the UDel Library Database

*   **OneSearch:** The central search tool that allows you to search across most of the library's resources, including books, articles, journals, and more.
*   **Specialized Databases:** The library subscribes to numerous specialized databases, each focusing on a specific subject area (e.g., JSTOR for humanities, PubMed for medicine, Compendex for engineering).
*   **E-journals:** Access to thousands of electronic journals, providing immediate access to the latest research.
*   **E-books:** A vast collection of electronic books covering a wide range of topics.
*   **Interlibrary Loan (ILL):** A service that allows you to borrow materials from other libraries if they are not available at UDel.

## Key Resources within the UDel Library Database

To effectively use the UDel library database, you need to be familiar with some of the key resources it offers:

*   **Academic Search Premier:** A multidisciplinary database providing access to a vast collection of scholarly articles.
*   **JSTOR:** A digital library containing a wide range of academic journals, books, and primary sources.
*   **PubMed:** A database specializing in biomedical literature, including medical research articles and abstracts.
*   **Web of Science:** A citation database allowing you to track the impact of research articles and identify key research trends.
*   **Scopus:** Another comprehensive citation database covering a wide range of scientific, technical, and medical literature.

## Effective Search Strategies for the UDel Library Database

Knowing *what* to search is only half the battle. You also need to know *how* to search. Here are some tips for crafting effective search queries:

*   **Use Keywords:** Identify the core concepts of your research topic and use them as keywords in your search query.
*   **Boolean Operators:** Combine keywords using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine your search results.
    *   **AND:** Narrows your search by requiring that both keywords appear in the results (e.g., "climate change AND Delaware").
    *   **OR:** Broadens your search by including results that contain either keyword (e.g., "artificial intelligence OR machine learning").
    *   **NOT:** Excludes results that contain a specific keyword (e.g., "Python programming NOT snakes").
*   **Phrase Searching:** Enclose phrases in quotation marks to search for the exact phrase (e.g., "information literacy").
*   **Truncation:** Use an asterisk (*) to truncate a word and search for variations of the word (e.g., "comput* " will find "computer," "computing," "computational," etc.).
*   **Field Searching:** Search within specific fields (e.g., title, author, abstract) to narrow your search results.
*   **Filters:** Use filters to refine your search results based on publication date, document type, subject area, and other criteria.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using the UDel Library Database

Even experienced researchers sometimes make mistakes when using the library database. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:

*   **Overly Broad Searches:** Using too many keywords or vague search terms can lead to an overwhelming number of irrelevant results.
*   **Ignoring Filters:** Failing to use filters to refine your search results can make it difficult to find the information you need.
*   **Relying on One Source:** Relying solely on OneSearch without exploring specialized databases can limit your access to relevant resources.
*   **Not Utilizing Interlibrary Loan:** Forgetting to use interlibrary loan when a resource is not available at UDel can prevent you from accessing crucial information.
*   **Lack of Citation Management:** Neglecting to use a citation management tool (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley) can make it difficult to organize and cite your sources accurately.
