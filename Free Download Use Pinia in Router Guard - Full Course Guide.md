## Why Use Pinia in Router Guards?

Router guards in Vue.js are powerful tools that allow you to control navigation within your application. They can be used to implement authentication, authorization, and other complex routing logic. However, accessing and managing state within these guards can sometimes be tricky. This is where Pinia, a lightweight and intuitive state management library, shines.

**Key Benefits:**

*   **Centralized State Management:** Pinia provides a central store for your application's data, making it easily accessible from anywhere, including router guards.
*   **Simplified Data Access:** Pinia's intuitive API simplifies reading and modifying state, making your router guards cleaner and easier to understand.
*   **Improved Code Organization:** By separating state management from routing logic, Pinia helps you create a more modular and maintainable codebase.
*   **TypeScript Support:** Pinia is built with TypeScript in mind, providing excellent type safety and improved developer experience.
*   **Vue Devtools Integration:** Seamless integration with Vue Devtools allows you to easily inspect and debug your application's state and actions.

## Understanding Vue Router Guards

Before diving into using Pinia, let's quickly review the different types of router guards available in Vue.js:

*   **Global Guards:** These guards are executed before any route is accessed. Examples include `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, and `beforeResolve`.
*   **Per-Route Guards:** These guards are defined directly on a route and are only executed when that specific route is accessed. Examples include `beforeEnter`.
*   **Component Guards:** These guards are defined within a Vue component and are executed when the component's route is accessed. Examples include `beforeRouteEnter`, `beforeRouteUpdate`, and `beforeRouteLeave`.

The `beforeEach` global guard is particularly useful for implementing authentication and authorization checks because it's executed before every route change.

## Practical Examples: Using Pinia in Router Guards

Let's explore some practical examples of how to use Pinia effectively in router guards. We'll focus on the `beforeEach` global guard for demonstration purposes.

**Example 1: Authentication Check**

Imagine you have a Pinia store that manages user authentication status. Let's say the store has a boolean property called `isAuthenticated`. You can use this property in a `beforeEach` guard to redirect unauthorized users to a login page.

```javascript
// Assuming you have a Pinia store named "useAuthStore"
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth';
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: () => import('@/components/HomePage.vue') },
    { path: '/login', component: () => import('@/components/LoginPage.vue') },
    { path: '/profile', component: () => import('@/components/ProfilePage.vue'), meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
  ],
});

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const authStore = useAuthStore();

  if (to.meta.requiresAuth && !authStore.isAuthenticated) {
    // Redirect to login page if authentication is required and user is not authenticated
    next('/login');
  } else {
    // Proceed to the next route
    next();
  }
});

export default router;
```

In this example, we first import the `useAuthStore` Pinia store. Then, inside the `beforeEach` guard, we get an instance of the store using `useAuthStore()`. We check if the route requires authentication (`to.meta.requiresAuth`) and if the user is not authenticated (`!authStore.isAuthenticated`). If both conditions are true, we redirect the user to the login page using `next('/login')`. Otherwise, we allow the navigation to proceed using `next()`.

**Example 2: Authorization Check**

You can also use Pinia to implement authorization checks. For example, you might have a user role stored in your Pinia store, and you want to restrict access to certain routes based on that role.

```javascript
// Assuming you have a Pinia store named "useAuthStore"
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth';
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: () => import('@/components/HomePage.vue') },
    { path: '/admin', component: () => import('@/components/AdminPage.vue'), meta: { requiresRole: 'admin' } },
  ],
});

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const authStore = useAuthStore();

  if (to.meta.requiresRole) {
    const requiredRole = to.meta.requiresRole;
    if (authStore.userRole !== requiredRole) {
      // Redirect to a forbidden page or display an error message
      next('/forbidden');
    } else {
      next();
    }
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

export default router;
```

In this example, we check if the route requires a specific role (`to.meta.requiresRole`). If it does, we compare the user's role (`authStore.userRole`) with the required role. If they don't match, we redirect the user to a forbidden page.

**Example 3: Redirecting Based on Store State**

Sometimes, you might want to redirect users based on the state of your application. For example, if a user has not completed their profile, you might want to redirect them to the profile completion page.

```javascript
// Assuming you have a Pinia store named "useUserStore"
import { useUserStore } from '@/stores/user';
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: () => import('@/components/HomePage.vue') },
    { path: '/complete-profile', component: () => import('@/components/CompleteProfilePage.vue') },
    { path: '/dashboard', component: () => import('@/components/DashboardPage.vue') },
  ],
});

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const userStore = useUserStore();

  if (to.path !== '/complete-profile' && !userStore.isProfileComplete) {
    // Redirect to the profile completion page if the profile is not complete
    next('/complete-profile');
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

export default router;
```

In this example, we check if the user is trying to access a page other than the profile completion page (`to.path !== '/complete-profile'`) and if their profile is not complete (`!userStore.isProfileComplete`). If both conditions are true, we redirect the user to the profile completion page.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Using Pinia in router guards is relatively straightforward, but there are a few common mistakes to watch out for:

*   **Not Calling the Store Function:** Remember that `useAuthStore` (or any store function) needs to be called to create an instance of the store. Failing to call the function will result in errors.
*   **Incorrect Store Import:** Ensure that you are importing the correct store function from the correct file path.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Avoid performing long-running asynchronous operations within router guards, as this can block navigation and degrade the user experience. If you need to perform asynchronous operations, consider using a loading indicator or a different approach.
*   **Infinite Redirect Loops:** Be careful to avoid creating infinite redirect loops. For example, if you redirect users to the login page if they are not authenticated, make sure the login page itself doesn't require authentication.
*   **Forgetting `next()`:** The `next()` function is crucial for allowing navigation to proceed. Forgetting to call `next()` will prevent the user from accessing the intended route.
