## Key Strategies for Succeeding in UB Classes (and Beyond)

Here are some key strategies covered in the downloadable course that you can start implementing right away:

### 1. Mastering Effective Study Techniques

*   **Active Recall:** Instead of passively reading or re-reading materials, actively try to recall information from memory. Use flashcards, practice quizzes, or simply try to explain concepts in your own words.
*   **Spaced Repetition:** Review material at increasing intervals over time. This helps to strengthen memory and improve retention. Apps like Anki can be invaluable for this.
*   **The Feynman Technique:** Choose a concept, try to explain it in simple terms as if you were teaching it to someone else. Identify any gaps in your knowledge and go back to fill them.
*   **SQ3R Method:** (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) A structured approach to reading and understanding textbooks.

### 2. Optimizing Time Management

*   **Prioritize Tasks:** Use methods like the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important) to prioritize tasks and focus on what matters most.
*   **Create a Schedule:** Develop a realistic schedule that allocates time for classes, studying, extracurricular activities, and personal time. Stick to your schedule as much as possible.
*   **The Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused bursts (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes). This can help to improve concentration and prevent burnout.
*   **Avoid Procrastination:** Identify the reasons why you procrastinate and develop strategies to overcome them. Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.
