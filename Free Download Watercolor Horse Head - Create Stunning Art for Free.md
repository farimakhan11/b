## Essential Watercolor Techniques for Painting Horses

Before you dive into the free course, let's explore some fundamental watercolor techniques crucial for painting realistic and captivating horse heads:

*   **Wet-on-Wet:** This technique involves applying wet paint onto wet paper, creating soft, blended edges. It's perfect for creating backgrounds, atmospheric effects, and soft fur textures.
*   **Wet-on-Dry:** Applying wet paint onto dry paper results in sharper lines and more controlled details. This is ideal for defining the horse's features, such as the eyes, muzzle, and individual strands of mane.
*   **Layering:** Watercolor is all about layering. Applying thin washes of color on top of each other builds depth and richness. Start with light washes and gradually add darker tones to create shadows and highlights.
*   **Dry Brushing:** Using a dry brush with a small amount of paint creates a textured effect, perfect for depicting the rough texture of the horse's coat or the individual hairs of the mane.
*   **Lifting:** This technique involves lifting paint from the paper using a clean, damp brush or sponge. It can be used to create highlights, correct mistakes, or add interesting textures.
*   **Masking Fluid:** Use masking fluid to protect areas of your paper from paint. This is especially useful for preserving white areas, such as the glint in the horse's eye.
