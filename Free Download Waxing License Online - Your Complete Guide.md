## Is an Online Waxing License Valid?

This is a crucial question! **Please note:** While this course provides comprehensive training in waxing techniques and theory, it **does not automatically grant you a legal waxing license.** Licensing requirements vary significantly by state and country. *This course is designed to prepare you for your state board exams and is not a replacement for the required in-person clinical training and testing*.

Before enrolling, **research your local regulations** regarding cosmetology or esthetics licensing. Many jurisdictions require a certain number of in-person training hours from an accredited institution before you can apply for a license. Use this course as a supplement to your formal education.
