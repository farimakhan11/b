## What is Vedic Maths and Why Should You Learn It?

Vedic Maths is a collection of techniques derived from the Vedas, ancient Indian scriptures.

## Unlocking the Power of Vedic Maths: Essential Techniques

Let's explore some of the most commonly used and effective Vedic Maths techniques:

*   **Ekadhikena Purvena (By One More Than the Previous One):** This Sutra is particularly useful for multiplying numbers ending in 5 or numbers close to a base (e.g., 10, 100, 1000).

    *   **Example:** 25 x 25 = ?
        *   Multiply 2 (the first digit) by the next higher number, which is 3: 2 x 3 = 6
        *   Multiply 5 x 5 = 25
        *   Combine the two results: 625

*   **Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah (All From 9 and the Last From 10):** This Sutra is used for subtracting numbers from powers of 10 (e.g., 100, 1000).

    *   **Example:** 1000 - 357 = ?
        *   Subtract each digit of 357 from 9, except for the last digit, which is subtracted from 10.
        *   9 - 3 = 6
        *   9 - 5 = 4
        *   10 - 7 = 3
        *   The answer is 643.

*   **Urdhva Tiryagbhyam (Vertically and Crosswise):** This versatile Sutra is used for multiplication and division. It involves multiplying digits vertically and crosswise and adding the results.

    *   **Example:** 23 x 31 = ?
        *   Multiply the units digits: 3 x 1 = 3
        *   Multiply crosswise and add: (2 x 1) + (3 x 3) = 2 + 9 = 11. Write down 1 and carry over 1.
        *   Multiply the tens digits: 2 x 3 = 6. Add the carry-over: 6 + 1 = 7
        *   Combine the results: 713

*   **Vertically and Crosswise Division:** This technique allows you to solve division problems mentally. It utilizes the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra but applied in reverse.

## Level Up Your Learning: Consider a Structured Vedic Maths Course
